<h3>Cross-grading guideline</h3>

The site keeps cross-grading anonymous as long as you don't put identifying information in the pdf. (Let me know if in some way it is not.) Of course you're free to write down your name and be known.

The main reason for cross-grading is for you guys to see your peers' work, which is a much better way to learn than to see my solutions.
<ul>
  <li>If you see great work, learn from the cool things that they do.</li>
  <li>If you see things that can be improved, show them a better way.</li>
  <li>Comment directly in the submission instead of starting a separate document. That way, your comments will be right next to the submitted work, thus the TA (Andy) and your peer can understand better.</li>
  <li>Write your comments in red.</li>
</ul>

Taking into account your comments, the Andy will assign the numerical grade.
